# Employee-Salary-Prediction-using-Random-Forest

## Overview
This project is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether an employee earns **>50K** or **<=50K** based on their personal and professional details. The prediction is powered by a Random Forest model trained on the "adult 3.csv" dataset, with SMOTE applied for class balancing.

## Features
- Interactive UI for entering employee details
- Real-time salary class prediction
- Uses Random Forest and SMOTE for robust, balanced results
- Clean, professional interface with dark theme

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- joblib

## Files
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `best_model.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model
- `label_encoders.pkl`: Label encoders for categorical features
- `scaler.pkl`: MinMaxScaler for numerical features
- `adult 3.csv`: Cleaned dataset for selectbox options

## How to Run
